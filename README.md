## Fantasy

Fantasy is a version control app for running tabletop roleplaying games. These games hold a tremendous amount of data, from character stats to maps and items. This app makes keeping a consistent master copy of all of this information easy, while allowing for multiple contributors.

### Phase I

The first phase of this app is centered on player created content. Players can add any of their characters to any of the campaigns they have been invited to. This way GMs will always be able to view the most current form of any characters belonging to their campaign.

GMs can add their own characters to their campaign as well. All PCs and NPCs can be accessed from the same place.

Players can view and update their own characters at any point, but cannot view or edit anyone else's.

### Phase II

The second phase focuses on the GM created content, namely lore, racial and occupation templates, maps, and story/plot hooks.

As a GM, users can create new pages for any of this content, and set it as public or private depending on whether players should be able to view it or not.

These pages will be organized within a repository structure, with each folder containing folders and or pages. Private pages or folders will be invisible to players viewing the repository.

To edit the pages, GMs will employ a rich text editor that will allow for embedded images.
